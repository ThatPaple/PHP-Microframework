<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a slim micro-framework template created for one of my bigger projects and soon to be my personal website. This is one of the earlier builds, and as mentioned, supports routing, middleware, auth, multi-language via JSON translation files, and losely follows the model-view-controller structure.

### Supports
- Bootstrap
- Templating (Included ``footer.php`` and ``navbar.php`` as an example)
- Custom language support through JSON files (Translation either by ``_('key')`` or through the ``Lang`` class; ``Lang::get('key')``)
    - Translations support nesting, such as ``key.value``, and can cover any depth ``section.key.value``
    - Locale either detected from the request header, session, or through user selection.
    - If a key is missing, the default fallback language is english.
      - Personal recommendation is making sure that english is always 100%, and then translate the files either with GAI or other translating tools.
- Middleware for Authentication and user role identification.
- Routing (Supports CRUD)
- Model-View-Controller structure
- Custom Debugging tools (``Functions::Puke(...)``, ``Helpers::debug($var)``)
- ``Helpers:sanitize()`` for sanitizing text/input
